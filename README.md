## Systems and Toolchains
The following are the primary systems and toolchains featured in the repository:

### Apache Spark
Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. It supports various data engineering tasks and can integrate with ML frameworks.

### TensorFlow
TensorFlow is a comprehensive ML framework for building and deploying machine learning models. It is used for neural network design, embedded machine learning, and deploying models to the cloud.

### PyTorch
PyTorch is a popular ML framework known for its dynamic computation graphs and ease of use for deep learning tasks. It is used for building neural network models and deploying them for various applications.

### Apache Kafka
Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform. It is used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.

### PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source relational database. It is used for data collection, storage, and SQL-based data processing. Additionally, PGAdmin4 is a web-based database management tool used for interacting with PostgreSQL databases.

## Data Used
The repository uses the NSL-KDD dataset, a modified version of the KDD'99 dataset, commonly used for evaluating intrusion detection systems. It provides a comprehensive collection of network traffic data for experimentation and analysis.
